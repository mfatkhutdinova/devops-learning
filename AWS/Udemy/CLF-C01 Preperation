AWS Global Accelerator VS CloudFront
- They both use the AWS global network and it's edge locations around the world
- Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoD protection
CloudFront - Content Delivery Network 
improves performance for your cacheable content (such as images and videos)
content is served as the edge

Global Accelerator 
no caching, proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions
improves performance for a wide range applications over TCP or UDP
good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fact regional failover 

AWS Outposts 
AWS Outposts are "server racks" that offers the same AWS infrastracture, services, APIs tools to build your own applications on-premises just as in the cloud
AWS will setup and manage "Outposts Racks" within your on-premises infrastracure and you can start leveraging AWS services on-premises 
YOU are responsible for the Outposts Rack physical security

AWS WaveLength
WaveLengt Zones are infrastracture deployments embedded with the telecommunications providers datacenters at the edge of the 5G networks
Ultra-low latency applications through 6G networks
Use cases: smart cities, ML-assisted diagnostics, real-time gaming...

AWS Local Zones
Places AWS compute, storage, database, and other selected AWS services closer to end users to run latency-senditive applications
Extend your VPC to more locations - "Extension of an AWS Region"

Amazon SQS = Simple Queue Service
Fully managed service (~serverless), use to decople applications
Messages are deleted after they are read by consumers
Consumers share the work to read messages & scale horizontally 
FIFO Queue = First In First Out

Amazon Kinesis
Kinesis = real-time big data streaming
Managed service to collect, process and analyze real-time streaming data at any scale
Kinesis Data Streams: low latency streaming to ingest data at scale from hundreds of thousands of sources
Kinesis Data Firehose: load streams into S3, Redshict, ElasticSearch, etc..
Kinesis Data Analytics: performreal-time analytics on streaming using SQL
Kinesis Video Streams: monitor real-time video streams for analytics or ML

Amazon SNS 
The "event publisher" only sends message to one SNS topic 
As many "event subscribers" as we want to listen to the SNS topic notifications
Each subscriber to the topic will get all the messages
Notification, publish subscribe = SNS 

Amazom MQ
When migrating to the cloud, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, we can use Amazon MQ
Amazon MQ is managed message brocker service for RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ


Cloud Monitoring 
CloudWatch - provides all metrics for every services in AWS
CloudWatch Alarms - alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric 
CloudWantch Logs - collect logs from:
- Elastic Beanstalk
- ECS
- AWS Lambda 
- CloudTrail 
- Route53 
By default, no logs from EC2 will go to CloudWatch
You need to run a CloudWatch agent on EC2 to push the log files you want

Amazon EventBridge 
Schedule: cron jobs (schedule scripts)
Event Pattern: event rules to react to a service doing something 
Trigger Lambda functions, send SQS/SNS messages

AWS CloudTrail
Provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS Account 
CloudTrail is enabled by default 
Get an history of events/API calls made within your AWS Account by: 
- console 
- SDK 
- CLI
- AWS Services 
Can put logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs or S3 
!! If a resource is deleted in AWS, investigate CloudTrail first!!

AWS X-Ray 
Debugging in Production, the good old way:
- test locally 
- add log statements everywhere 
- re-deploy in production 
- tracing and get visual analysis of your application
Log formats differ across applications and log analysus is hard 

AWS X-Ray - visual analisys of our applications. Advantages:
- for troubleshooting 
- understand dependencies in a mocroservice architecture 
- pinpoing service issues
- review request behavior 
- find errors and exceptions 

Amaxon CodeGuru

- Shows historical information for each day 
- Has an RSS feed you can subscribe to 
- Previously called AWS Service Health Dashboard 

AWS Health Dashboard provides alerts and remediation guidance when AWS is experiencing events that may impact you.

VPC Section
VPC - Virtual Pricate Cloud: private network to deploy your resources (regional resource)
Subnet - allow you to partition your network inside your VPC (Availability Zone resource)
A Public subnet - is a subnet that is accessibke from the Internet 
A Private subnet - is a subnet that is not accessible from the Internet 
To define access to the Internet and between subnet, we use Route Tables. 

Inetrnet Gateways helps our VPC instances connect with the Internet 
Public Subnet have a route to the Internet gateway.

NAT Gatways & NAT Instances allow your instances in your Private Subnet to access the Internet while remaining private.

NACL (Network ACL)
- A firewall which controls traffic from and to Subnet
- Can have ALLOW and DENY rules
- Are attached at the Subnet level 
- Rules only include IP Addresses

Security Groups
- A firewall that controls traffic to and from an ENI/an EC2 Instance 
- Can have only ALLOW rules
- Rules include IP addresses and other security groups 


VPC Flow Logs 
Capture information about IP traffic goiong into your interfaces:
- VPC Flow Logs
- Subnet Flow Logs 
- Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs 
Helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues. 
Captures netword information from AWS managed interface too: Elastic Load Balancers, ElastiCache, RDS, Aurora
VPC Flow logs data can go to S3, CloudWatch Logs and Kinesis Data Firehose 

VPC Peering 
Connect two VPC, privately using AWS' network 
Make them behave as if they were in the same network 
Must not have overlapping CIDR (IP adress range)
VPC Peering connection is not transitive (must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one another)

VPC Endpoints 
Endpoints allow you to connect to AWS Services using a private network instead of the public www network 
This gives you enhanced security and lower latency to access AWS Services 
VPC Enpoint Gateway: S3 & DynamoDB
VPC Endpoint Interface: the rest 

AWS PrivateLink (VPC Endpoint Services)
- Most secure & scalable way to expose a service 1000s of VPCs
- Does not require VPC peering, internet gateway, NAT, route tables...
- Requires a network load balancer (Service VPC) and ENI (Customer VPC)

Site to Site VPN 
- Connect an on-premises VPN to AWS 
- The connection is automatically encrypted 
- Goes over the public internet 

Direct Connect (DX)
- Establish a physical connection between on-premises and AWS 
- The connection is private, secure and fast 
- Goes over a private network 
- Takes at least a month to establish 

On premises: must a Customer Gateway (CGW)
AWS: must use a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)


AWS Client VPN 
Connect from your computer using OpenVPN to your private network in AWS and on-premises
Allow you to connect to your EC2 instances over a private IP 
Goes over public internet 

Transit Gateway 
For having transitive peering between thousands of VPC and on-premises, hub-and spokke (star) connection
One single Gateway to provide this functionality 
Works with Direct Connect Gateway, VPN connections 

Security & Compliance 
- AWS responsobility - Security of the Cloud
Protecting infra (hardware, software, facilities and networking) that runs all the AWS services 
Managed services like S3, DynamoDB, RDS, etc
- Customer responsobility - Security in the Cloud 
For EC2 instance, customer is responcible for management of the guest OS (including security patches and updates), firewall & network configuration, IAM 
Encrypting application data

Data at rest VS Data in transit 
1. At rest: data stored or archivied on a device 
2. In transit (in motion): data being moved from one location to another 
3. We want to encrypt data in both states to protect it!
For this we leverage encryption keys 

AWS KMS - Key Management Service 
CloudHSM - AWS provisions encryption hardware 

Types of Customer Master Keys: CMK 
- Customer Managed CMK: 
Create, manage and used by the customer, can enable ot disable 
Possibility of rotation policy 
- AWS managed CMK: 
Created, managed and used on the customer's behalf by AWS 
Used by AWS services 
- AWS owned CMK:
Collection of CMKs that an AWS service owns and manages to use in multiple accounts
AWS can use those to protect resources in your account 
- CloudHSM Keys 
Keys generated from your own CloudHSM hardware device 
Cryptographic operations are performed withing the CloudHSM cluster 

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
- Let's you provisio, manage and deploy SSL/TLS Certificates
- Used to provide in-flight encryption for websites - HTTPS
- Automatic TLS certificate renewal
