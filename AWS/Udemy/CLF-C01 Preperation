IAM - Global Service

IAM Credentials report lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials. The other IAM Security Tool is IAM Access Advisor. It shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
You only want to use the root account to create your first IAM user, and for a few account and service management tasks. For every day and administration tasks, use an IAM user with permissions.
An IAM policy is an entity that, when attached to an identity or resource, defines their permissions.

AWS Snow family 
highly-security, portable devices to collect and process data at the edge, and migrate data into and out of AWS
Data migration: Snowcone, Snowball Edge, Snowmobile 
Edge computiong: Snowcone, Snowball Edge

AWS Snow Family: offline devices to perform data migrations 
If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball devices!

Amazon Glacier Deep Archive is the most cost-effective option if you want to archive data and do not have a retrieval time requirement. You can retrieve data in 12 or 48 hours.
AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that gives you on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage.
AWS Snowcone is a small, portable, rugged, and secure edge computing and data transfer device. It provides up to 8 TB of usable storage.
Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices are well suited for large-scale data migrations and recurring transfer workflows, as well as local computing with higher capacity needs.

DB 
Redshift
Based on Postgresql but not for OLTP
OLAP - online analytical processing 
Columnar storage of data (instead of row based)
BI tools such as Tableau integrate with it

Amazon EMR
Elastic MapReduce
EMR helps creating Hadoop clusters (Big Data) to analyze and process vast amount of data
Supports Apache Spark, HBase, Presto, Flink
Use cases: data processing, machime learning, web indexing, big data

Amazon Athena
Serverless quesry service to perform analytics against S3
Use standart SQL language
Use cases: BI, analytics, reporting
Exam TIP: amalyze data in S3 using serverless SQL -- use Athena

Amazon QuickSight
Serverless machine learning-powered BI service create interactive Dashboard
Use cases: Business analytics, building vizualizations, perform ad-hoc analytics, get business insight using data
Integrated with RDS, Aurora, Athena, Redshift, S3

DocumentDB
DocumentDB is the same for MongoDB (which is NO Sql DB)
MongoDB is  used to store. query anf index JSON data

Amazon Neptune
Fully managed graph db
A popular Graph dataset would be a social network
Greate for knowledge graph (Wikipedia), fraud detection, recommendation engines, social networking

Amazon QLDB
QLDB - stands for "Quantum Ledger Database"
A ledger is a book recording financial transactions
Used to review history of all changes made to your application data over time
Immutable system: no entry can be removed or modified, cryptographically verifiable
Difference with Amazon Managed Blockchain: no decentralization component, in accordance with financial regulation rules

Amazon Managed Blockchain
Blockchain makes it possible to build applications where multiple parties can execute transactions without the need for a trusted, central authority.
Is managed service to:
- join public blockchain network 
-create your own scalable private network

AWS Glue
Managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service
Useful to prepare and transform data for analytics
Fully serverless service 

DMS - Database migration service 
Quickly and securely migrate databases to AWS, resilient, self healing 
The source database remains available during the migration

Summary:
Relational db - OLTP: RDS & Aurora (SQL)
Differences between Multi-AZ, Read Replicas, Multi-Region 
In-Memory Database: ElasticCache
Key/Value db: DynamoDB (serverless) & DAX (cache for DynamoDB)
Warehouse - OLAP: Redshift (SQL)
Hadoop Cluster: EMR 
Athena: query data on Amazon S3 (serverless & SQL)
QuickSight: dashboards on your data (serverless)
DocumentDB: "Aurora for MongoDB" (JSON - NoSQL database)
AmazonQLDB: Financial Transactions Ledger (immutable journal, cryptoghraphically verifiable)
Amazon Managed Blockchain: managed Hyperledger Fabric & Euthereum Blockchains
Glue: Managed ETL (Extract Transform Load) and Data Catalog service
Database Migration: DMS
NeptuneL grapch database
