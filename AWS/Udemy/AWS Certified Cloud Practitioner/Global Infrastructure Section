AWS Global Accelerator VS CloudFront
- They both use the AWS global network and it's edge locations around the world
- Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoD protection
CloudFront - Content Delivery Network 
improves performance for your cacheable content (such as images and videos)
content is served as the edge

Global Accelerator 
no caching, proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions
improves performance for a wide range applications over TCP or UDP
good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fact regional failover 

AWS Outposts 
AWS Outposts are "server racks" that offers the same AWS infrastracture, services, APIs tools to build your own applications on-premises just as in the cloud
AWS will setup and manage "Outposts Racks" within your on-premises infrastracure and you can start leveraging AWS services on-premises 
YOU are responsible for the Outposts Rack physical security

AWS WaveLength
WaveLengt Zones are infrastracture deployments embedded with the telecommunications providers datacenters at the edge of the 5G networks
Ultra-low latency applications through 6G networks
Use cases: smart cities, ML-assisted diagnostics, real-time gaming...

AWS Local Zones
Places AWS compute, storage, database, and other selected AWS services closer to end users to run latency-senditive applications
Extend your VPC to more locations - "Extension of an AWS Region"


Global Applications in AWS - Summary
• Global DNS: Route 53
  - Great to route users to the closest deployment with least latency
  - Great for disaster recovery strategies
• Global Content Delivery Network (CDN): CloudFront
  - Replicate part of your application to AWS Edge Locations – decrease latency
  - Cache common requests – improved user experience and decreased latency
• S3 Transfer Acceleration
  - Accelerate global uploads & downloads into Amazon S3
• AWS Global Accelerator
  -  Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network
• AWS Outposts
  - Deploy Outposts Racks in your own Data Centers to extend AWS services
• AWS WaveLength
  - Brings AWS services to the edge of the 5G networks
  - Ultra-low latency applications
• AWS Local Zones
  - Bring AWS resources (compute, database, storage, …) closer to your users
  - Good for latency-sensitive applications
