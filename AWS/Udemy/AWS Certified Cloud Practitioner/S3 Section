S3 Encryption 
Server-side encryption (default)
1. upload to s3
2. encrypt

Amazon S3 – Security
• User-Based
• IAM Policies – which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM

Resource-Based
• Bucket Policies – bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
• Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain (can be disabled)
• Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common (can be disabled)

Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
• The user IAM permissions ALLOW it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
• AND there’s no explicit DENY

Encryption: encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys

Client-side encryption
1. encrypt
2. upload to s3
