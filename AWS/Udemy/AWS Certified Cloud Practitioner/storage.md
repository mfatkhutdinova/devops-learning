# Storage Section

#### EBS Volume
- An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
- It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
- They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP level)
- They are bound to a specific availability zone
- Analogy: Think of them as a “network USB stick”
- Free tier: 30 GB of free EBS storage of type General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic per month

#### EC2 Instance Store
- EBS volumes are network drives with good but “limited” performance
- If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store
- Better I/O performance
- EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they’re stopped (ephemeral)
- Good for buffer / cache / scratch data / temporary content
- Risk of data loss if hardware fails
- Backups and Replication are your responsibility

#### EFS – Elastic File System
- Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on 100s of EC2
- EFS works with Linux EC2 instances in multi-AZ
- Highly available, scalable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use, no capacity planning

#### EC2 Instance Storage - Summary
- EBS volumes:
  - network drives attached to one EC2 instance at a time
  - Mapped to an Availability Zones
  - Can use EBS Snapshots for backups / transferring EBS volumes across AZ
- AMI: create ready-to-use EC2 instances with our customizations
- EC2 Image Builder: automatically build, test and distribute AMIs
- EC2 Instance Store:
  - High performance hardware disk attached to our EC2 instance
  - Lost if our instance is stopped / terminated
- EFS: network file system, can be attached to 100s of instances in a region
- EFS-IA: cost-optimized storage class for infrequent accessed files
- FSx for Windows: Network File System for Windows servers
- FSx for Lustre: High Performance Computing Linux file system
