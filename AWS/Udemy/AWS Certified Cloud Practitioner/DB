DB
DynamoDB 
DynamoDB is a fast and flexible non-relational database service for any scale. It can scale with no downtime, it can process millions of requests per second, and is fast and consistent in performance.

Redshift
Based on Postgresql but not for OLTP
OLAP - online analytical processing 
Columnar storage of data (instead of row based)
BI tools such as Tableau integrate with it

Amazon EMR
Elastic MapReduce
EMR helps creating Hadoop clusters (Big Data) to analyze and process vast amount of data
Supports Apache Spark, HBase, Presto, Flink
Use cases: data processing, machime learning, web indexing, big data

Amazon Athena
Serverless quesry service to perform analytics against S3
Use standart SQL language
Use cases: BI, analytics, reporting
Exam TIP: amalyze data in S3 using serverless SQL -- use Athena

Amazon QuickSight
Serverless machine learning-powered BI service create interactive Dashboard
Use cases: Business analytics, building vizualizations, perform ad-hoc analytics, get business insight using data
Integrated with RDS, Aurora, Athena, Redshift, S3

DocumentDB
DocumentDB is the same for MongoDB (which is NO Sql DB)
MongoDB is  used to store. query anf index JSON data

Amazon Neptune
Fully managed graph db
A popular Graph dataset would be a social network
Greate for knowledge graph (Wikipedia), fraud detection, recommendation engines, social networking

Amazon QLDB
QLDB - stands for "Quantum Ledger Database"
A ledger is a book recording financial transactions
Used to review history of all changes made to your application data over time
Immutable system: no entry can be removed or modified, cryptographically verifiable
Difference with Amazon Managed Blockchain: no decentralization component, in accordance with financial regulation rules

Amazon Managed Blockchain
Blockchain makes it possible to build applications where multiple parties can execute transactions without the need for a trusted, central authority.
Is managed service to:
- join public blockchain network 
-create your own scalable private network

AWS Glue
Managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service
Useful to prepare and transform data for analytics
Fully serverless service 
The AWS Glue Data Catalog is a central repository to store structural and operational metadata for all your data assets.

DMS - Database migration service 
Quickly and securely migrate databases to AWS, resilient, self healing 
The source database remains available during the migration

Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)
Is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for Amazon DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10 times performance improvement—from milliseconds to microseconds—even at millions of requests per second.

Summary:
Relational db - OLTP: RDS & Aurora (SQL)
Differences between Multi-AZ, Read Replicas, Multi-Region 
In-Memory Database: ElasticCache
Key/Value db: DynamoDB (serverless) & DAX (cache for DynamoDB)
Warehouse - OLAP: Redshift (SQL)
Hadoop Cluster: EMR 
Athena: query data on Amazon S3 (serverless & SQL)
QuickSight: dashboards on your data (serverless)
DocumentDB: "Aurora for MongoDB" (JSON - NoSQL database)
AmazonQLDB: Financial Transactions Ledger (immutable journal, cryptoghraphically verifiable)
Amazon Managed Blockchain: managed Hyperledger Fabric & Euthereum Blockchains
Glue: Managed ETL (Extract Transform Load) and Data Catalog service
Database Migration: DMS
