Compute services:
1. EC2 - resizable compute capacity
2. Auto Scaling - encrease or decrease number of instances
3. Elastic Load Balanser - dstribute incoming traffic
3. Elastic Container Service - run applications on a managed cluster
4. Elastic Kubernetes Service - run K8s applications on AWS and on-premises
5. AWS Lambda - run code in response to events

Benefits of EC2:
- Elasticity 
- Control 
- Flexibility 
- Integrated 
- Reliable
- Secure 
- Cost-Effective 
- Easy 

Scaling on AWS:
- Launch new instances in advance of peak period 
- Use monitoring to programmatically scale out 
- Automatically scale in 
- Pay for the resources needed, only when needed

Elastic Load Balanser:
Automatically distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances 
- Increases avialability and fault tolerance
- Configure health check 
- Offload encryption and decryption 
- Types: 
  - application load balancer (app layer)
  - network load balancer (network layer)
  - gateway load balancer (third-party virtual appliances)
