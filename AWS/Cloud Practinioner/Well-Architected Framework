Build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure

Operational excellence
Pillar focused on running and monitoring systems, and continually improving processes and procedures.
Key topics include change automation, event response, and standards for managing daily operations.

Security
The security pillar describes how to take advantage of cloud technologies to protect data, systems, and assets in a way that can improve your security posture.

Reliability
The reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected to. 
This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle. 
This paper provides in-depth, best practice guidance for implementing reliable workloads on AWS.

Performance Efficiency
The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

Cost Optimization
The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

Sustainability
The ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all 
components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.
