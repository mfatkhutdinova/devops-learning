Cloud Economics = Business value and cloud financial management
Business Value is more that just up front cost savings 

********* Business value ************
Cloud Value Framework:
1. Cost savings - The financial benefits of moving to the cloud
2. Staff productivity - The efficiency gained from reducing or eliminating tasks no longer needed with the cloud
3. Operational resilience - The benefit from improved availability and security
4. Business agility - Being able to respond faster and experiment more

A cost saving analysis calculates the total cost of ownership for running an end-to-end traditional IT environment versus deploying to AWS. 

AWS helps customers lower costs with:
- A consumption-based model
- AWS pricing models
- Frequent price reductions

Which of the following is  migration challenge for customers discussed in this course?:
- Migration related costs
- Shutting to an operational expenditure (opex) model
- lack of cloud readiness
- entrenched IT organization

Staff productivity refers to the efficiency gained from reducing or eliminating  tasks no longer needed with cloud services.

Application - roles such as data base administrators, AppDev, QA, and support functions
Security - ensures infrastructure meets compliance, regulatory, and corporate standards
Flicities - facilities management for customers who have an on-premises data center
Server, Network and storage - involves managing hardware infrastructure

Network benefits - Time spent on network planning and forecasting to provision hardware is greatly reduced 
Application benefits - Time spent coding, testing, and supporting business apps is greatly reduced
Facilities benefits - Time spent managing power and cooling systems are eliminated
Security benefits - Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and security audits are greatly improved
Storage benefits - Time spent on supporting physical arrays is eliminated
Server benefits - Time spent installing, upgrading, and removing hardware is reduced by up to half

Operational resilience = uptime + security 
Security - Uses AWS automation and tools, and provides AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Operations - Leverages automation, manages services end to end, monitors API access
Infrastracture - Enables customers to run applications and failovers across multiple AZs and Regions
Software - automates continuous integration and delivery workflow, runs smaller code deployments

Software - Resource exhaustion, computational errors, inadequate monitoring, or failed upgrades
Infrastracture - Hardware failures, natural disasters, power outages, volumetric attacks
Security - Malware, network attacks, unpatched applications, poor or limited authentication
Operational - Human errors, configuration errors, procedural errors, and common place accidents


Business agility means responding faster, experementing more and delivering results in the same or less amount of time
Question: Business agility allows customers to innovate by increasing "fail fast" while reducing risks and costs. Which of the following best describes this concept of "fail fast"?
Answer: being able to easily shut down failed initiatives without the pain and wasted resources assosiated with the inflexible in-premises environment

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for measuring business agility:
- New applications launched per year
- Adoption of new features
- Deployment frequency
- Employee retention


********* Cloud financial management ************
Pay for that you use

Planning and forecasting:
- AWS Pricing Calculator
- AWS service pricing pages
- AWS Price list AP
- AWS Cost Explorer
- Migration Portfolio Assessment (MPA)

Cloud financial management keys:
- establishing cost transparency, to ensure visibility into and accountability for spend 
- cost optimization 
- planning and forecasting 
- cloud financial operations

Four best practices of cost optimization:
- Instance right-sizing
- Increasing elasticity
- Choosing the right pricing model
- Matching usage to storage class (optimizing storage)

Questions: Enabling cost transparency and leveraging tools for measuring and monitoring costs and usage data are examples of which key area of cloud financial management?
Answer: Measurement and accountability

Cost optimization - Identifying waste, building cloud-friendly architectures, improving cost efficiency
Planning and forecating - Understanding current and future costs and IT needs, driving accurate planning
Measurement and accountability - Establishing cost transparency and accountability to ensure visibility into spend
Cloud financial management - Identifying and investing in people, processes, tools, and automation

On-demand: Pay for compute capacity by the second with no long-term commitments.
Reserved instances: Make a 1 or 3-year commitment for a significant discount. Best for steady-state workloads
Spot instances: Spare EC2 capacity; best for fault-tolerant, flexible, and stateless workloads


MPA: Migration Portfolio Assessment:
- MPA is a web application that automates the process of portfolio analysis, and helps customers validate the migratiom business case and create migration plan.
- MPA is available to all Advances and Premier tier APN Partners.
- Key feautures of the MPA tool
