Cloud Economics = Business value and cloud financial management
Business Value is more that just up front cost savings 

********* Business value ************
Cloud Value Framework:
1. Cost savings - The financial benefits of moving to the cloud
2. Staff productivity - The efficiency gained from reducing or eliminating tasks no longer needed with the cloud
3. Operational resilience - The benefit from improved availability and security
4. Business agility - Being able to respond faster and experiment more

A cost saving analysis calculates the total cost of ownership for running an end-to-end traditional IT environment versus deploying to AWS. 

AWS helps customers lower costs with:
- A consumption-based model
- AWS pricing models
- Frequent price reductions


Network benefits - Time spent on network planning and forecasting to provision hardware is greatly reduced 
Application benefits - Time spent coding, testing, and supporting business apps is greatly reduced
Facilities benefits - Time spent managing power and cooling systems are eliminated
Security benefits - Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and security audits are greatly improved
Storage benefits - Time spent on supporting physical arrays is eliminated
Server benefits - Time spent installing, upgrading, and removing hardware is reduced by up to half

Operational resilience = uptime + security 
Security - Uses AWS automation and tools, and provides AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Operations - Leverages automation, manages services end to end, monitors API access
Infrastracture - Enables customers to run applications and failovers across multiple AZs and Regions
Software - automates continuous integration and delivery workflow, runs smaller code deployments

Business agility means responding faster, experementing more and delivering results in the same or less amount of time

Pay for that you use

Planning and forecasting:
- AWS Pricing Calculator
- AWS service pricing pages
- AWS Price list AP
- AWS Cost Explorer
- Migration Portfolio Assessment (MPA)


On-demand: Pay for compute capacity by the second with no long-term commitments.
Reserved instances: Make a 1 or 3-year commitment for a significant discount. Best for steady-state workloads
Spot instances: Spare EC2 capacity; best for fault-tolerant, flexible, and stateless workloads


MPA: Migration Portfolio Assessment:
- MPA is a web application that automates the process of portfolio analysis, and helps customers validate the migratiom business case and create migration plan.
- MPA is available to all Advances and Premier tier APN Partners.
- Key feautures of the MPA tool
