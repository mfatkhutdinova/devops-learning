Cloud Economics = Business value and cloud financial management
Business Value is more that just up front cost savings 

Cloud Value Framework:
1. Cost savings - The financial benefits of moving to the cloud
2. Staff productivity - The efficiency gained from reducing or eliminating tasks no longer needed with the cloud
3. Operational resilience - The benefit from improved availability and security
4. Business agility - Being able to respond faster and experiment more

A cost saving analysis calculates the total cost of ownership for running an end-to-end traditional IT environment versus deploying to AWS. 

AWS helps customers lower costs with:
- A consumption-based model
- AWS pricing models
- Frequent price reductions


Network benefits - Time spent on network planning and forecasting to provision hardware is greatly reduced 
Application benefits - Time spent coding, testing, and supporting business apps is greatly reduced
Facilities benefits - Time spent managing power and cooling systems are eliminated
Security benefits - Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and security audits are greatly improved
Storage benefits - Time spent on supporting physical arrays is eliminated
Server benefits - Time spent installing, upgrading, and removing hardware is reduced by up to half

Operational resilience = uptime + security 
Security - Uses AWS automation and tools, and provides AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Operations - Leverages automation, manages services end to end, monitors API access
Infrastracture - Enables customers to run applications and failovers across multiple AZs and Regions
Software - automates continuous integration and delivery workflow, runs smaller code deployments
