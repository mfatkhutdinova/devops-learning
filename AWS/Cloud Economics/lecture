Cloud Economics = Business value and cloud financial management
Business Value is more that just up front cost savings 

Cloud Value Framework:
1. Cost savings - The financial benefits of moving to the cloud
2. Staff productivity - The efficiency gained from reducing or eliminating tasks no longer needed with the cloud
3. Operational resilience - The benefit from improved availability and security
4. Business agility - Being able to respond faster and experiment more

A cost saving analysis calculates the total cost of ownership for running an end-to-end traditional IT environment versus deploying to AWS. 

AWS helps customers lower costs with:
- A consumption-based model
- AWS pricing models
- Frequent price reductions
